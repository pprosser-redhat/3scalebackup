to use the openshift_raw module, you need to install the Openshift rest client

I had problems with installing the client on Mac, had to install python with brew in the end.


Bug in Ansible on Mac OSX

objc[4134]: +[__NSPlaceholderDate initialize] may have been in progress in another thread when fork() was called.

to fix, before executing ansible playbook, type in

export OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES

debug playbook add -vvv

tried using the command below rather than inlining the Yaml but I just can't get it to work
definition: "{{ lookup('url', 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pprosser-redhat/3scalebackup/master/backup_amp/ansible_definitions/system-storage.yml') | from_yaml}}"
